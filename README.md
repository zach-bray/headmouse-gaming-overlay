#headmouse-gaming-overlay

WIP

Working on a tool for my friend Wes. A customizble overlay tool to assist him playing video games, where he is limited to using a Headmouse as his only form of input. Hopefully this can help others aswell.

Only written for MacOS, maybe I can expand it if others can use it.

Still got a lot of work to do....
